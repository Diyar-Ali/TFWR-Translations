Farming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology. 
Here's what the same program looks like after a few speed upgrades:

Unlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression. 

Programming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time. 

While it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before. 

If you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.
